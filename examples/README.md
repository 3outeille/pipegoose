### Hybrid tensor parallelism and data parallelism training

Support for hybrid 3D parallelism for ðŸ¤— `transformers` will be available in the upcoming weeks (it's basically done, but it doesn't support ðŸ¤— `transformers` yet)

`nproc-per-node` is equal to tensor_parallel_size * pipeline_parallel_size * data_parallel_size. **You must have at least 4 GPUs to run 2D parallelism.**

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=4 hybrid_parallelism.py
```
